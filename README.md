# Netflix-Content-Analysis-Dashboard

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: Netflix Content Analysis Dashboard! ðŸ“Š

In this project, I analyzed Netflixâ€™s extensive movie and TV show catalog to uncover trends in content distribution, top-performing countries, and rating classifications. Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that provides insights into Netflixâ€™s evolving content strategy.

ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights:
ðŸš€ Release Year Trends â€“ Netflix saw a major content surge in 2017 and 2018 (767 titles each), followed by 2016 (658 titles).
ðŸš€ Movies vs. TV Shows â€“ The platform offers 6,131 movies compared to 2,676 TV shows, emphasizing its strong focus on films.
ðŸš€ Top Content-Producing Countries â€“ Leading countries include the United States, India, and the United Kingdom, with significant contributions from Japan, South Korea, and Canada.
ðŸš€ Content Ratings â€“ The most common ratings are TV-MA (2,062 titles) and TV-14 (1,427 titles), indicating a strong focus on mature audiences.
ðŸš€ Top Directors â€“ Notable directors featured include Rajiv Chilaka, Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, Jay Karas, and Cathy Garcia-Molina, among others.

This dashboard helps media analysts, content strategists, and streaming enthusiasts gain deeper insights into Netflixâ€™s content trends and global expansion. Excited to continue exploring streaming analytics! ðŸš€ðŸŽ¬
